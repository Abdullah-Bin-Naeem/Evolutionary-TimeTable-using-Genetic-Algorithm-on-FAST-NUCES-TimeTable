# Evolutionary Timetable using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements an evolutionary algorithm to generate a timetable while satisfying given constraints.

## Hard Constraints
1. No teacher has more than one class at a time.
2. No student has more than one class at a time.

## Soft Constraint
- No teacher can have more than one class in a day.

## Input Data
- Input data can be found in `data/Input/Course Allocation.xlsx`.

## Results
- Results can be found in `data/Result/TimeTable.xlsx`.

## Preprocessing
You need to preprocess the data as shown in the start of the `Evoltionary_Timetable_using_Genetic_Algorithm.ipynb` to match the format used in `data/Input/Course Allocation.xlsx`.

## How to Run
- Clone or download this repository and just run the jupyter notbook file
- Yes its that simple üßÅ
